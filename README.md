# haskell-experiments
Let's learn some haskell!

## Very quick setup
https://haskell-lang.org/get-started

## Gist with great instructions to set up on Intellij

There's support for many editors and many guides out there, so you can still pick your ~~poison~~ favourite editor. Up to you!

## Learning resources

This one is apparently one of the best out there:
